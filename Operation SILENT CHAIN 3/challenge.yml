David Holmes is just one link in the chain. Field intelligence suggests he’s connected 
to a larger corporate network quietly enabling Silent Chain’s operations in Syria. 
Analysts believe the company he works for is not only aware of these activities but directly involved.
Your next mission: identify the individual at the top of this organization. Follow Holmes’s professional footprint and technical contributions. 
The answer lies with those who know where to look.
