**INTELLIGENCE REPORT 3/6
The online alias @syriaobserver has been active across technical forums and quietly distributing tools to other operatives. 
Intelligence suggests one of these tools may carry traces of its creator perhaps a real name accidentally left behind. 
This slip could be the key to identifying the individual behind the alias.

Your mission: Investigate their digital footprint and uncover the true identity of the person operating under @syriaobserver
