**INTELLIGENCE REPORT 6/6 
The Gulfstream flight you tracked in the previous operation wasn’t just moving supplies it delivered key Silent Chain operatives into Syria. 
Hours later, a high-resolution satellite image from a CIRU reconnaissance pass captured activity at a remote staging zone suspected 
to be their primary base of operations.
All intelligence points here. This is the final link in Silent Chain’s network. 
Locate their stronghold, confirm its coordinates, and pave the way for CIRU’s decisive strike. 
The success of this mission and countless lives depends on you.
